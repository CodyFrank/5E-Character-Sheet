# 5E-Character-Sheet
Flatiron React/Redux Project creating a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) fifth edition character sheet
This project is made to replace the outdated paper options of character sheets.
The goal of this project is to create a way for D&D players to keep **clean** character sheets that dont have erase makes and written over text.
This goal has been accomplished by allowing users to rewrite every stat and spell that the game includes virtually. *No erasing when you get more money or level up*
